This mod, when activated, will attempt to make your game into "Borderless" mode (Also known as Borderless Window, Fullscreen Window, and probs many more...things)

It does so via the Win32 API, so it is only compatible with Windows, if anyone knows of a cross platform way to do this in Unity, go a head and create a better version of this mod ;)
